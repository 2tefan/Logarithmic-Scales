# Logarithmic Scales

During the sRDP (written secondary school exit exam in Austria) I got a little bit confused because there was a straight line on a diagram with both the x and y-axis on a logarithmic scale and I needed to pick the right function to describe this phenomenon.
I was pretty sure that it had to look something like `y(x) = a * c ^ x` but because both axis were on a logarithmic scale I thought it could be a linear function (`y(x) = a * x + c`).
But in the end it was `y(x) = a * x ^ c` ðŸ« .

At home, I wanted to understand it visually, so instead of learning for the other school exit exams, I decided to procrastinate and create this notebook.
